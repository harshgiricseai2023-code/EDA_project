# EDA_project

🎯 Objective
Perform EDA to explore the dataset, detect patterns, correlations, outliers, and data quality issues.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python
pandas, numpy → data handling
matplotlib, seaborn → visualization

📌 Steps Performed

Data Inspection → Shape, types, missing values
Summary Stats → Mean, median, spread
Univariate Analysis → Histograms, countplots
Bivariate Analysis → Scatterplots, boxplots
Correlation Study → Heatmap, strong relations
Outlier Detection → IQR & boxplots
Data Quality Checks → Missing values, datatype issues

✅ Key Insights

Found missing values in some columns
Strong correlations between a few numerical features
Outliers detected using IQR method
Some columns may need type conversion

🚀 How to Run
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
python eda_script.py
